       - "   &1JukeAlert&r\nAn alarm system for your castle and a way to spy on your friends and enemies. Use Citadel to reinforce a noteblock or a jukebox. Noteblocks will alert you when someone not on the group walks past, and jukeboxes will store a log of nearby activities"
       - "such as opening chests and breaking blocks. \"/ja\" will open a GUI. It is dangerous to steal from people who have mastered both JukeAlert and PrisonPearl..."
       - "   &1FactoryMod&r\nStoke the fires of industry by filling a chest with 8x64 charcoal, placing a crafting table next to the chest, and then a furnace containing more charcoal next to the crafting table. Hit the crafting table with a stick twice, add wood to the chest, and then"
       - "hit the furnace with a stick. You are now a wealthy charcoal baron capable of producing one of many items faster and more efficiently than those savages still using furnaces! Type \"/fm\" for more info – almost all items have factories."
       - "   &1RealisticBiomes&r\nYou will starve! Crops and trees require sunlight or glowstone, grow slowly across the board, and do not grow in inappropriate biomes. This encourages trade and warfare because diverse crops are required for FactoryMod XP production."
