potions:
#Allows applying a multiplier to the intensity of potions. Intensities <= 1.0 will always work fine, but intensities > 1 
#may lead to unintended results for instant effects like INSTANT_HEALTH.
#All entries may have the following entries:
# type:
#   A potion type (https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/potion/PotionType.html)
# upgraded:
#   Boolean to specify whether the pot is upgraded (tier 2) 
# extended:
#   Boolean to specify whether the pot is extended
# splash:
#   Boolean to specify whether the pot is splash 
# multiplier:
#   Double value, the multiplier applied to the duration. May not be negative and defaults to 1.0

#   ---
#All values specifying the kind of option are optional and will wildcard if not specified, for example:

#An entry applying to all extended splash potions:
#    splash:
#      splash: true
#      extended: true
#      multiplier: 0.8

#Or one applying only to speed 8, both splash&drinkable
#    speed8:
#      type: SPEED
#      extended: true
#      multiplier: 0.8
  potIntensity:
    splash:
#All splash pots reduced

velocity:
#In newer Minecraft versions when a player launches a projectile the players velocity will be added to the projectiles base velocity. This can lead to 
#weird behavior sometimes and reverted with this setting. Add entity types (https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html) 
#of projectiles to the list to revert their behavior regarding initial velocity to 1.7

#Key of the entry is the type of damage modified, allowed here are: ALL, SWORD, SHARPNESS_ENCHANT, STRENGTH_EFFECT, ARROW, POWER_ENCHANT, CRIT
#'multiplier' is the multiplier applied to the preexisting vanilla damage, defaults to 1.0
#'mode' is the mode used to apply the multiplier for types with different levels like SHARPNESS_ENCHANT. Allowed are LINEAR and EXPONENTIAL
#'flatAddition' is a flat amount added per level. Flat addition is applied before the multiplier

#The order in which modifiers are applied is: ALL, ARROW, POWER_ENCHANT, STRENGTH_EFFECT, SWORD, SHARPNESS_ENCHANT, CRIT
#Note that these effects are applied after vanilla damage additions and before vanilla damage reductions
