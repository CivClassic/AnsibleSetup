# -- 'use-internal-tps' Should clearlag just use the calculated internal TPS? (Improves accuracy)
# -- 'language' Clearlag supports multiple languages (https://github.com/bob7l/Clearlag-Languages) translated by the community
# -- 'use-internal-tps' Should Clearlag use Spigot's /tps? (Updated by minutes, much slower, but more accurate!)

#Controls ALL of Clearlag's broadcasting. Disabling this will disable ALL broadcasting on Clearlag
# -- 'enabled' Should clearlag broadcast messages at all? (Example: Auto-removal, warnings, ect)

#Monitors your server's main thread for locking/freezing. Helps figure out what's causing lag-spikes
# NOTE: This will outprint mostly just stacktraces. It's up to YOU to interpret the stacktrace
# NOTE: (!Important!) Clearlag will print EVERYTHING to your Spigot/Bukkit server logs!
# NOTE: A large 'Garbage collection time' generally means the spike was caused by the Garbage collector (Memory issue basically..)
# -- 'enabled' Should this be enabled (Prints data to your logs, not ingame chat)
# -- 'min-elapsed-time' How long (IN MILLISECONDS) of a server-tick constitutes a freeze/lock? I don't recommend going under ~80
# -- 'check-interval' How often (IN MILLISECONDS) should the server be checked? Lower the number, more accurate the timings
# -- 'follow-stack' Should Clearlag keep printing the stacktrace every time it changes (Can be very spammy)?
